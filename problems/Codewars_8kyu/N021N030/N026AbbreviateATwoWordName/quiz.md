# Abbreviate a Two Word Name



Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

```
Sam Harris` => `S.H
Patrick Feeney` => `P.F
```



```ruby
Test.describe("Example test cases") do
  Test.assert_equals(abbrev_name("Sam Harris"), "S.H")
  Test.assert_equals(abbrev_name("Patrick Feenan"), "P.F")
  Test.assert_equals(abbrev_name("Evan Cole"), "E.C")
  Test.assert_equals(abbrev_name("P Favuzzi"), "P.F")
  Test.assert_equals(abbrev_name("David Mendieta"), "D.M")
end
```

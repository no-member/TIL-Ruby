# Remove First and Last Character

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

```ruby
Test.describe("Basic tests") do
Test.assert_equals(remove_char('eloquent'), 'loquen')
Test.assert_equals(remove_char('country'), 'ountr')
Test.assert_equals(remove_char('person'), 'erso')
Test.assert_equals(remove_char('place'), 'lac')
Test.assert_equals(remove_char('ok'), '')
end
```
